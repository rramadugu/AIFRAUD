---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

Each CSV file in `/data` contains at least 7 fields:
- `transaction_id`
- `customer_id`
- `merchant_id`
- `amount`
- `timestamp`
- `device_type`
- `is_fraud`

Optional fields such as `geolocation`, `browser`, and `session_id` can be added as needed.

---

## 🧬 Federated Learning Ready

Includes tools to:
- Split datasets into client-specific subsets
- Train isolated models per client
- Analyze data distribution and performance per region or node

---

## 📈 Scalability

This project can be extended to:
- Stream real-time transaction logs via Apache Kafka
- Deploy RESTful prediction APIs with FastAPI or Flask
- Integrate into cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure)

---

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

- Each function is modular and testable
- Models are trained and evaluated using common metrics: accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall
- Sample confusion matrices and classification reports included

---

## 📘 Documentation & Media

Inside `/docs`:
- System architecture and model flow
- Performance and ROC curve diagrams
- Editable `AIFRAUD_Presentation.pptx` with summary slides
- Screenshots of dashboards and outputs

---

## 🔄 Dataset Customization

Want to change data?
- Modify `src/module_2.py` and `module_3.py` to support new fields
- Regenerate CSV files using the included data simulator logic

---

## 🧪 Example Output (Jupyter Notebook)

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("../data/data_1.csv")
print(df.describe())

df['is_fraud'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
plt.title("Fraud vs Legit Transactions")
plt.show()
